A "CSS framework" made by me and my friend tem. It tries to look like Bootstrap, even uses some of the Boostrap elements. I'm uploading this now due to a lack of motivation from both of us, and we simply didn't want to continue a project that no one will ever use. That is all, don't use this. Use Bootstrap.
